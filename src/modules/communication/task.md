let also build our ddd communication module. 1. Role of the Communication Module
Acts as a single point of outbound communication for the system.
Handles all channels: email, SMS, WhatsApp, push notifications, OTPs, etc.
Does not contain domain logic of other modules (Auth, Order, KYC) — it only knows how to send messages.
Can optionally include templates, logging, retry policies, and rate-limiting.

2. Scalability Considerations
Channel-agnostic: Each service (email, SMS, etc.) implements a common interface (sendMessage, sendOTP) so modules don’t care which provider is used.
Event-driven integration: Other modules emit domain events (UserRegistered, OrderDelivered) → Communication Module subscribes to events and triggers messages.
Queue-ready: Use a message broker (RabbitMQ, Redis, or built-in NestJS queues) to handle high-volume messaging asynchronously.
Centralized templates & logging: Keeps tracking and auditing consistent across all communications.

3. Standards / Principles
Shared Module: Make it a global/shared module so other modules can import it without circular dependencies.
Interface-driven: Each channel implements a standard interface; domain modules call abstracted services.
Decoupled: Domain modules emit events or call the communication interface, never implement message logic themselves.
Extensible: Adding a new channel should not require changes in domain modules.
Configurable: Providers, rate-limits, templates, etc., should be environment-driven.

Domain modules only know events or interfaces.
Communication module knows channels and providers.
External providers are abstracted away from domain logic.

✅ Summary:
Make it a global/shared module.
Use interfaces and dependency inversion for extensibility.
Keep it event-driven and provider-agnostic.
All other modules use it through abstracted services or event listeners, never directly implementing communication logic.  for now priorise sending
